# holbertonschool-shell

Welcome to the **Holberton School Shell** project repository! ðŸ‘‹
This project serves as a collection of hands-on exercises designed to build fundamental and intermediate shell and scripting skills on Unix-based systems.
Each directory explores essential concepts in shell navigation, permissions, I/O redirections, and shell initialization files â€” with practical, tested scripts.

---

## Repository Structure

- **`basics/`**: Filesystem navigation, shell commands, scripting basics
- **`permissions/`**: File and directory permissions, ownership, and relevant utilities
- **`io_redirections_and_filters/`**: Input/output redirection, filters, and shell text processing
- **`init_files_variables_and_expansions/`**: Shell init files, variables, expansions, aliases, and arithmetic

Each subdirectory contains scripts corresponding to specific tasks, and a dedicated `README` explaining each script in detail.

---

## General Requirements

- All scripts are **exactly two lines long** (`wc -l file` prints `2`)
- Scripts must begin with:
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
